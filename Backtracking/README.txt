@Provide estimates of your time: 
@How much time you think this assignment will take, and how much it actually took.

I honestly thought this assignment is a relatively easy assignment as I tackled the ‘solve’ method quite easily. So, by the time I finished the first method, I thought a good one day would do for this assignment. 

However, as I moved onto the next ‘findAllSolutions’ method, I started regretting not designing my approaches ahead and brute-forcing the first method. 

I spent much much more time on coming up with a neat / clean way to write the second method, and only was able to come up with a good approach after realizing the puzzle can either be a tree and a DAG. 

At the end of the day, it took me good 4 days coming up with a solid approach, and a half day actually implementing. 

@Before : thought 1 day be enough
@After : took me 4~5 days total.
